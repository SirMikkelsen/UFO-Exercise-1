# Diary

#### Timestamp 15.27  Think of it as a personal log.

Many short entries are better than few long.

It can help you in documenting things like:
* How long did it take to do X
What misunderstandings arose
Which micro-experiments were done
Which false leads were taken

When you have an objective diary, you can better look on happened. You will then be able to argue from your concrete experience that so and so must be the case.


Keep the diary in the source code project (so it is at hand)
Set a timer for every X minutes (typically every hour or so)
Write short entries (must be possible to do in 2-3 minutes). For example:
* Datetime stamp
15:27
* Problem being working on
Extracting text from bitmap
* What file you are working in
Program.cs
* What is currently your frustration
Converting png to bmp
* When you were last in contact with your team-mates
15:27
* URL of example or idea you are trying out
